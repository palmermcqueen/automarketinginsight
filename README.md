### **Car Market Data Analysis**  

#### **Description**  
This lab project focuses on analyzing car market data to identify key trends and relationships between variables such as price, mileage, year of production, and brand. Using statistical and visualization techniques, we explore how different factors influence car pricing and provide data-driven insights for buyers and sellers.  

#### **Objectives**  
- Analyze trends in car prices over time.  
- Compare average car prices by brand.  
- Examine the correlation between price and mileage.  
- Generate insights to help in market decision-making.  

#### **Tools Used**  
- **Excel**: Data preprocessing, calculations, and correlation analysis.  
- **Tableau/Power BI**: Data visualization (optional for advanced analysis).  
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)**: Additional statistical analysis (optional).  

#### **Key Findings**  
- The average price of cars has shown a steady increase over the years.  
- Certain brands (e.g., Ford, Audi, Volkswagen) have higher average prices compared to others.  
- There is a strong negative correlation between mileage and priceâ€”higher mileage leads to lower prices.  

#### **Potential Improvements**  
- Expand analysis to include additional factors like fuel type, transmission, and location.  
- Use machine learning models to predict car prices based on key attributes.  

This project serves as a foundation for understanding car market dynamics and can be extended further with advanced analytics and predictive modeling. ðŸš—ðŸ“Š
